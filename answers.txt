Questions for GP 5/9/19

Do my wav files have to be in the same folder that is playing .py
"campersong/mistergood.wav" is better / yes

What aspects of basic set up are always necessary

What is command (?) to repeat previous code (?)
up arrow, if you continue it scrolls

Better way to shut down pi?

code executed on raspberry pi - reads temp sensor and does computer equivalent of shouting at another computer - we call this shouting/talking an http request

pi makes request, my  mac runs code that is meant to listen for requests in same language, language is not programming language it's a protocol

web server is a piece of code / program designed to listen to these (http) requests, we call it 'http requests'

We are living in http world (could have done fttp or other protocols, torrent, w/e)
(ssh is another protocol, is a connection - terminal emulator)

Web server code is server.py

Ports are little virtual holes on computer that are available for listening to info
Address to send data in and out - Used for communications between processes on computer and not on computer

Http requests can have info attached, using to get info from pi to mac

Gotta know https: method, headers, payload for requests
Response has response code, headers, payload

HTTP methods:
GET - to get info
	Go to website, on browser, implicitly issuing a GET request - starts everything - usually asking for info, expecting data to be in the response

POST - to send info
	Implied that you're attaching data w/ the request, up to web server whether you want data in response
	Designed specifically for attaching data
